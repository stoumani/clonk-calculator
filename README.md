# Clonk
## _All-in-one calculator_



Clonk is an All-in-one calculator that provides functionalities
like basic arithmetic, scientific notation, plotting, and memory input.

## Features
##### Calculation & Parsing:
- Basic operations and operators: + - * / mod ^ E () && || ! < > >= <= != ~ & | << >> xor
- Fault-tolerant parsing of strings: log 5 / 2 .5 (3) + (2( 3 +5 = ln(5) / (2.5 * 3) + 2 * (3 + 5)
- Expressions may contain any combination of numbers, functions, units, variables, vectors and matrices, and dates
- Supports complex and infinite numbers
- Basic constants: pi, e, etc.
##### Results
- Supports all common number bases, as well as negative and non-integer radices, sexagesimal numbers, time format, and roman numerals
- Many customization options: precision, max/min decimals, complex form, multiplication sign, etc.
##### Plotting:
- Uses matplotlib
- Can plot functions or data (matrices and vectors)
- Ability to save plot to PNG image, postscript, etc.
- Several customization options

## Tech

Clonk uses a number of open source python libraries to work properly:

- [matplotlib] - Interactive plot graphs
- [numpy] - Scientific computation
- [math] - Python3 standard library for mathematical constants
- [tkinter] - Python Tk GUI 

And of course Clonk itself is open source with public repo on GitHub.
